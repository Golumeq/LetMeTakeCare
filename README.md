# LetMeTakeCare - Sustainable Delivery Application

The idea behind the "LetMeTakeCare" project was to create an innovative application that allows for more sustainable delivery of packages, contributing to the reduction of emissions during transportation. Our application enables users to deliver packages during their trips, making use of existing routes and means of transportation in a more efficient way.

## Project Status

Currently, the project is in the conceptual development phase, where we have outlined the general functionality. We plan to implement further development stages and improvements to provide users with the highest quality of service.

## Inspiration

The "LetMeTakeCare" project was born during the MERN course conducted by Dave Grey. The inspiration behind creating this application was the desire to promote a more sustainable and ecological way of delivering packages by utilizing existing means of transportation.

## How to Use

To use the "LetMeTakeCare" project, follow these steps:

1. Open the backend project in your development environment.
2. Modify the `.env` file to configure the database connection.
3. Start the backend application using the `npm run dev` command.
4. Open the frontend project in your development environment.
5. Launch the frontend application using the `npm start` command.
6. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to start using the application.

## Features

The "LetMeTakeCare" project offers a range of features, including:

- Responsive design that adapts to various devices.
- Ability to add and edit users.
- Creating and modifying delivery orders.
- Assigning users to specific delivery orders.
- Implementation of user roles (this feature is under development).
- Marking orders as completed.
- Handling various types of errors and implementing CORS security.

## Technologies

The "LetMeTakeCare" application was created using the following technologies:

- MongoDB database, which provides fast data access and supports geolocation, which is crucial for our project.
- Express.js framework for building the backend server.
- React library for building the user interface.
- Node.js environment as the server platform.

## Database

We chose MongoDB as our database due to its fast data access and support for geolocation, which perfectly supports our goals of delivering packages in a more eco-friendly way.
